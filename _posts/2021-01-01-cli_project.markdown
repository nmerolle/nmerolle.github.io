Ok so I have made about 10 false starts on scraping only to find I could not find a reasonably scrapeable website that I was interested in. So after spending time watching videos and learning about API’s it is on to API’s for the remainder of the project. I have settled on working on an application that will allow me to access information from everyone favorite role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (disclaimer: I haven’t even played 5e).

To go enough levels deep I have chosen to create a list of available character classes and from that list select a class to view a list of spells available to that class and from there select a spell and read a description or retrieve some relevant information.

I have currently got a working model of my application but I am not sure as to whether or not it satisfies all of the requirements. The instructions for the project states “ Pro Tip: Avoid scraping data more than once per web page — utilize objects you have already created. It will speed up your program!” . However I have found that this is not always the case and after some clarification a better way to say this would be don’t pull the same data twice. I only include this here because I was stuck for sometime unnecessarily.

I have to say I am not sure what is really expected with the blog, but I will try to make it more technical next time.
